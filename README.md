# Acorns

## Overview and Origin

Acorns is a personal finance company that allows individuals automatically invest change from rounding up purchases. This change is invested in diversified portfolios of ETFs. It was founded in February 29, 2012 by a father-son duo Walter and Jeff Cruttenden.[<sup>1</sup>](#1) [<sup>2</sup>](#2) It is currently headquartered in Irvine, CA, and has approximately 260 employees as of 2020.[<sup>3</sup>](#3) So far, Acorns has went through 13 funding rounds for a total funding of 507 million USD, most recently raising 300 million USD in their Series F round on March 9, 2022.[<sup>1</sup>](#1)

## Business Activities

Acorns target customers are those who might not be as financially savvy to make active investment decisions, and/or those who might not have significant cash flow to be putting away to save. Generally, these customers are in low- and middle-income households. There is a disparity in the financial knowledge and capability between this income group and high-income households which are able to invest large sums and take higher risks. Acorns solves the this issue by making saving very easy. Every debit or credit purchase is rounded up to the nearest dollar, and the difference is automatically invested into a diversified portfolio. Unlike other robo advisors or investment accounts that require some level of investment decision making, Acorns enables effectively effortless saving.[<sup>4</sup>](#4)

Around 80% of the US population falls into the low/middle income bracket, where we take the upper range of middle class as double the national median income.[<sup>5</sup>](#5) Napkin math shows that around 200 million adults fall into this category! Acorns was the first company to come up with this unique micro-investing idea [<sup>6</sup>](#6), and therefore has established itself quite soundly in this space. Acorns calls it Round-Ups <sup>:registered:</sup>[<sup>7</sup>](#7), and this trademark has helped them stand out from all the other personal finance companies.

Acorns is available on web, iPhone, and Android phones. There is a variety of technologies utilized to deliver their products: JS, React, PostgreSql, Redis, Amazon S3 + EC2, Ruby, Scala, Apache Spark, Swift, Android SDK and more.[<sup>8</sup>](#8) The bulk of the technology lies in the backend - ingesting millions of users's transactions, managing different portfolio styles based on personalized risk tolerance. Acorns offers investment, retirement, and checking accounts, each requiring custom architecture.

## Landscape

Acorns is in the personal finance + wealth management industry. Since the launch of Betterment, the first robo-advisor, in 2008, this industry has exploded in popularity with dozens of competitors, including established banks to unicorn startups such as Acorns. The ease and accessibility of digital finance management, paired with lower barrier to entry with automated investing has resulted in anywhere from few hundred billion to few trillion dollars in assets under management (AUM).[<sup>9</sup>](#9) The offerings of these companies vary from retirment accounts, aggressive market exposure, high income savings accounts, crypto exposure, high yield loans, and many, many more. The popularity of cryptocurrency has steadily risen over the past decade, and recently the finance industry has taken notice. Makara, Titan Invest, Domain Money are some examples of newer crypto heavy robo-advisors. Established companies have also begun to provide crypto exposure as well, albiet more hesitantly due to the high risk nature. Among robo advisors, the biggest competitors to Acorns are:[<sup>10</sup>](#10)
- Vanguard ($206.6 billion AUM with 1.1 million users)
- Schwab ($65.8 billion AUM with 262,000 users)
- Betterment ($26.8 billion AUM with 615,000 users)
- Wealthfront ($21.4 billion AUM with 307,000 users)
- Personal Capital ($16.1 billion AUM with 26,000 paid users)
- Bloom ($5.0 billion AUM with 24,000 users)

## Results

Acorns has around $4.7 billon AUM, and with an impressive 4.4 million paid subscribers. It's clear that it has appealed to a large swath of the US population with Round-Ups, an innovative and easy way for anyone to start saving. The CEO Noah Kerner outlines both the focus of the company and the future of the industry in strong words: ''I really do believe that the next generation of great financial companies are going to be defined by integrity. We’re talking about hardworking Americans who are saving 5% to 7% … of their income. We’re not a wealth management platform for the 5%… I don’t give a fuck about people who have money. I’m focused on people who are working hard to achieve the American dream.''[<sup>4</sup>](#4)

The golden metric for the success of robo-advisors is AUM. Robo-advisors primarily make money through management fees. Generally, this ranges from 0-0.75% annually. There are also other potential fees based on trading, advisory services, loans, etc. What this translates to is that higher AUM increases income.[<sup>11</sup>](#11) Acorns is the 7th largest robo-advisor by AUM, but boasts a much higher paid user count than the larger competitors. Acorns has an uncommon management fee structure - for a personal pricing plan it costs \$3 flat per month (\$36 annually).[<sup>12</sup>](#12) With approximately 4 million subscribers, this brings Acorns revenue from their paid subscriptions to \$144 million. To compare to the first robo advisor Betterment, it has a 0.25% annual fee for it's robo-advising services, which brings their revenue to \$67 million.

Another metric is portfolio performance. This metric measures the benefit to the customers, which also influences where customers choose to place their money. The top robo advisors by 2.5 year annualized returns, netting out fees are:[<sup>13</sup>](#13):
- SigFig (4.71%)
- Axos Invest (4.38%)
- TIAA (4.20%)
- SoFi (4.03%)
- Fidelity Go (3.88%)

Acorns scores at 3.49%, which scores middle of the pack for that performance report. This is only a small piece of the puzzle, as account minimums, ease of use, offered products, and advisory services make a big differene. Many users do not look for 2.5 annualized returns and instead look for concrete features. Given Acorns high customer count, they are one of the bigger players in this industry.

## Recommendations

There are few potential avenues for Acorns to expand its reach and success. One is expansion internationally. There are many regulatory barriers to jump through, but the potential wealth that can be accessed in countries like China or India is huge. Acorns' flat pricing fee favors means that high user count is key to increasing revenue - assets per user is less relevant. Such an initiative would require large investment in migrating the service into those target languages, as well as country specific technogical infrastructure for managing information, offering customer service, etc. This would be a huge undertaking in scaling existing architecture.

Another opportunity is to add additional pricing tiers for premium services. For an additional \$1 or \$2 per month, Acorns could offer financial education advisory services, higher bonuses on Round-Ups, more choices for retirement accounts, and more. This could captivate existing users that already love the existing products to give the premium tier(s) a chance, and in turn support additional development of Acorns financial ecosystem. This wouldn't necessarily require new technologies. A potential premium service such as connecting with professional advisors would require messaging/calling coordination tech.

Lastly, Acorns could add savings accounts. For dedicated users, Acorns could become the one stop shop for most of their financing needs: checkings, savings, investing, retirement. This would bring additional AUM and increase user engagement, as having money split between multiple accounts decreases attention and assets per account. There are regulatory requirements that would require a whole new backend to manage and process savings assets. Savings have a very different risk profile from investment accounts, so a whole new set of financial models have to be created to generate savings.
